## Installation

RDSH Viewer is a portable application.

## Configuration

Add a FQDN of RDP server to `RDS Hosts` list via `settings`. If `RDS Hosts` list is empty, application will open it for filling in automatically. The application launches a connection to user's session in two modes: the first mode is a session control, where you can move your cursor and send keyboard keys to a remote PC, and the second mode is view-only mode, where you do not have a remote control at all.
